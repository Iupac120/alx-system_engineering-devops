For many years, the de facto standard for the C programming language was the book The
C Programming Language, written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie in 1978. This
book is commonly known in the programming community as simply K&R (referring to
the initials of the authors) and finds a place on many programmersâ€™ bookshelves to this
day. However, the book was written as a tutorial introduction to C, not as a comprehensive
or official standard for the language. As different vendors offered varying implementations
of the C language, differences between those implementations began to appear.
Fearing that C might lose its portability, a group of compiler vendors and software developers
petitioned the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to build a standard for
the C language in 1983. ANSI approved the application and formed the X3J11 Technical
Committee to work on the C standard. By the end of 1989, the committee approved the
ANSI standard for the C programming language.
